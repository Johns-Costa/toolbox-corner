## Design

The design of the application is based on Material Design principles. The colors are chosen to be consistent.
The minimalistic approach was used to create something meaningful without moving out of the customer's focus.

### Color Scheme

The application's color scheme is based on the combination of bold and neutral colors. The bold colors are used to create a more vibrant and attractive user experience. The neutral colors are used to create a more calm and relaxed user experience.


The navbar is colored colored with a light grey background (`#F0F0F0`) with a dark gray text and a dark blue logo (`#003366`).
The banner and the footer have a dark blue background (`#003366`) and light grey text (`#F0F0F0`) to emphasize the application's main content.

The main content has a white background with and black text in order for the user to focus on the products.

### Typography

The Logo is in [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/?query=roboto) font and the body in Arial, sans serif in order to make it simple and easy on the eye.
